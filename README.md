# Advent of Code Solutions

My [AOC](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions from some years.

Every year I like to challenge myself to solve as many puzzles as I can mange.
It's always a fun exercise to enhance my overall programming skills and an opportunity to improve my skills for a special language.
Please note that I tend to do quick-and-dirty solutions which will be quite ugly but do the job.

## Stars per language

## Note

You won't be able to run the days by just cloning the repo.

In a previous version of the repository I've also added the inputs, but redistribution of the puzzle inputs would be against [AOC's terms of use](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7lesj5/comment/drlt9am/).

In order to run the solutions you should be able to use the provided test-input of each day, or put your personalized puzzle inputs in the right place.

To download your personalized inputs you can use:
```bash
curl --cookie "session=<COOKIE>" https://adventofcode.com/20xx/day/x/input --output dayxx.txt
```

You should be able to find your cookie using your browser.
E.g. in chrome:
* Press F12 (developer options)
* On the top locate "Application" tab
* On the left side locate "Cookies"
* Find session cookie value and copy paste
